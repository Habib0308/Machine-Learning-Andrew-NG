# Machine Learning
ML are agorithms that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programed.

# Learning Theory
A computer program is said to learn from Experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P if its performance on T as measured by P improves with the experience E

# Supervised Learning

# Regression Problem
Y is continuous

# Classification Problem
Y is discrete

# Unsupervised Learninng
Given an input X without Y and find me a pattern in this data.

**Unsupervised Learninng IS NOT CLUSTERING**
* Organize Computing Clusters
* Social Network Analysis
* Market Segmentation
