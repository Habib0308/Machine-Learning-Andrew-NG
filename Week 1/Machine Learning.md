# Machine Learning
ML are agorithms that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programed.

## What is Machine Learning?
**Arthur Samuel:**

"The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This is an older, informal definition.

**Tom Mitchell:**

"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

Example: playing checkers.

E = the experience of playing many games of checkers

T = the task of playing checkers.

P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:

Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.
